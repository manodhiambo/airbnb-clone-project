# AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview

This project is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform AirBnB. The goal is to build a functional web application that allows users to browse property listings, view detailed property information, and complete bookings. This includes frontend development, backend APIs, database design, and deployment.

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- **Authentication:** JWT / OAuth
- **Design:** Figma
- **Deployment:** Vercel / Netlify (Frontend), Render / Railway / AWS (Backend)

## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals

- Create an intuitive and seamless booking flow
- Maintain visual consistency across all pages and components
- Ensure fast load times and optimized performance
- Prioritize responsiveness for mobile and desktop users

### Key Features

- Property search and filtering
- Detailed property viewing
- Secure checkout process
- User authentication (Sign Up, Login, Logout)

### Primary Pages

| Page                 | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Property Listing View | Grid display of available properties with filters                          |
| Listing Detailed View | Complete property details with images, amenities, and booking form         |
| Simple Checkout View  | Streamlined payment and booking confirmation interface                     |

### Importance of User-Friendly Design

A well-designed booking system minimizes user friction, increases conversion rates, and enhances customer satisfaction. Features such as intuitive navigation, responsive layouts, and a clear visual hierarchy make the platform more accessible and enjoyable for users.
